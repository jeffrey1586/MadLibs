# MadLibs

Jeffrey Chong, 11304669.</br>
App Studio, week 2.</br>

Android users can choose one of the 5 stories in this MadLibs app.</br>
Some words in the stories are kept blank.</br>
It is up to the user to add the words. After all the words are prompt,</br>
the app wil display the full story with the inserted words from the user.</br>

Extra:
- a drop down menu (spinner) when a story can be chosen (second picture, Activity2.java OnCreate).</br>
- The title changes in the last activity, based on which story the user has chosen (last picture, Activity4.java OnCreate).</br>
